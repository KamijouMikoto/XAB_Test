# TTS Demo Files


This repository contains demo files for comparison between emotion speech generated by CycleGAN and VAW-GAN. A new file can be added as follows:

Add files named `{file_name}_{emotion}_{model}.wav` into the folder `out/samples`. `file_name` is the original file name, `emotion` is the abbreviated generated emotion (`amused -> amu`, `anger -> ang`, `disgust -> dis`, and `sleepy -> sle`), and model is one of `cyc` or `vaw` for CycleGAN and VAW-GAN, respectively.
